# Deep Learning-Based Bird vs. Drone Detection for Aerial Object Classification
This research focuses on developing an efficient bird vs. drone detection system using machine learning, specifically employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify aerial objects into birds and drones. The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and a custom CNN model with 3 convolutional layers.

# **Setup Instructions:**
To set up the environment and run the research, follow the steps below:

**Prerequisites:**
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.x,
TensorFlow 2.x or later,
Keras,
Matplotlib (for plotting),
NumPy,
Google Colab (optional, but recommended for easier execution)

**Dataset:**
The "Drone vs Bird: Aerial Object Classification Dataset" can be downloaded from Kaggle. It contains images of birds and drones, which are used for binary classification tasks in this research.

**Google Colab Setup:**
You can run the code directly on Google Colab. To get started:
Open a new notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the dataset to your Google Drive and mount it in Colab.
Clone the repository to access the code.

# **Course Instructor Acknowledgment:**
This research was conducted under the guidance of Md. Mynoddin, who provided valuable insights and support throughout the project. Special thanks to the Deep Learning for providing the foundational knowledge and resources for this work.
